ghBackup
=========

ghBackup is an R package that backs up your GitHub repositories. It uses 
a GitHub personal access token to clone repositories from a GitHub 
organization and save the files in the destination directory.
[Simple examples](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/ghBackup/articles/) on how to back up repositories and upload backup files 
to a Google Drive folder on a schedule are provided. 

# Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("nmfs-ost/ghBackup")
```
# Usage
 
```r
library(ghBackup)
```

Use `ghBackup::back_up_gh_orgs()` to download clones of all public and 
private repositories of an organization your token can access. Clones of
all repositories will be saved in the destination directory
`C:/Users/ghbackup/` and a zip archives of clones of all repositories 
will be created under parent directory `C:/Users/`.

```r
ghBackup::back_up_gh_orgs(
  gh_token = gh::gh_token(),
  backup_path = "C:/Users/ghbackup/"",
  orgs_name = c("nmfs-general-modeling-tools")
)
```
